# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

##  Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.  
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and design **targeted marketing strategies**, improve customer experience, and optimize revenue.

The analysis is performed using Python with exploratory data analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

---

##  Objectives
- Segment customers into distinct groups
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Identify high-value and low-value customer segments
- Support personalized marketing and business strategies

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset includes customer-related features such as:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Income
- Spending score
- Purchase behavior metrics

Each row represents a unique customer.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  Analysis & Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering implementation
- Visualization of customer segments

---

##  Key Insights
- Customers can be grouped into distinct segments based on spending behavior
- Certain clusters represent **high-value customers**
- Segmentation enables targeted promotions and personalized offers
- Helps reduce marketing cost and improve conversion rates

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Focus premium offers on high-value clusters
- Design budget-friendly offers for price-sensitive customers
- Personalize communication based on customer segment
- Improve retention strategies using segmentation insights
